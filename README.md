### About
I’m a Full-Stack Developer focused on building clean, reliable, and user-friendly web applications.  
My main stack is **Python and Next.js (React)**, supported by **Supabase, SQL, Streamlit**, and lightweight AI tools (**OpenAI, Hugging Face**).  
I enjoy connecting logic, design, and data to create web apps that people can actually use.  

I trained through a **34-week intensive program at MolenGeek** and completed the **IBM AI Developer certification** (Generative AI, NLP, Hugging Face).  
I value clarity, collaboration, and continuous learning and I love contributing to meaningful, production-ready projects.
